# Migration from expo-barcode-scanner to expo-camera

## ✅ Migration Complete

Your project has been successfully migrated from the deprecated `expo-barcode-scanner` to the modern `expo-camera` approach for Expo SDK 52+.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- ❌ Removed: `expo-barcode-scanner: ^13.0.1`
- ✅ Kept: `expo-camera: ~16.0.18` (already present)

### 2. Configuration Updated (app.json)
- ❌ Removed: `expo-barcode-scanner` plugin
- ✅ Added: `expo-camera` plugin with proper permissions configuration

### 3. Code Already Modern
Your code was already using the correct modern approach:
- ✅ Using `CameraView` from `expo-camera`
- ✅ Using `onBarcodeScanned` prop
- ✅ Using `barcodeScannerSettings` for barcode types
- ✅ Proper camera permissions handling

## Current Implementation Features

### Supported Barcode Types
Your scanner supports these barcode/QR code types:
- QR codes
- EAN-13, EAN-8
- Code 128, Code 39
- UPC-A, UPC-E
- Codabar

### Camera Features
- ✅ Flash toggle
- ✅ Front/back camera (currently set to back)
- ✅ Proper permission handling
- ✅ Animated scan line
- ✅ Modern CameraView component

## Optional Improvements

### 1. Add More Barcode Types
You can expand the supported barcode types in your `barcodeScannerSettings`:

```javascript
barcodeScannerSettings={{
  barcodeTypes: [
    'qr',
    'ean13',
    'ean8',
    'code128',
    'code39',
    'code93',
    'code39mod43',
    'upc_a',
    'upc_e',
    'codabar',
    'itf14',
    'interleaved2of5',
    'datamatrix',
    'pdf417',
    'aztec',
  ],
}}
```

### 2. Camera Facing Toggle
You can add a button to switch between front and back cameras:

```javascript
const [facing, setFacing] = useState('back');

const toggleCameraFacing = () => {
  setFacing(current => (current === 'back' ? 'front' : 'back'));
};

// In your CameraView:
<CameraView
  style={styles.camera}
  facing={facing}
  // ... other props
>
```

### 3. Zoom Controls
You can add zoom functionality:

```javascript
const [zoom, setZoom] = useState(0);

// In your CameraView:
<CameraView
  zoom={zoom}
  // ... other props
>
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the scanner functionality to ensure everything works as expected
2. Run `expo prebuild` if you're using development builds
3. Test on both iOS and Android devices
4. Consider adding the optional improvements mentioned above
